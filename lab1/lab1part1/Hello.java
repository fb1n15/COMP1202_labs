//During this lab I may have encountered:  "';' expected error", and the way to fix it would be to put semicolon at the end of the System.out.println() statement
//The other error I could see could be "class (...) is public, should be declared in a file named (...).java", and to fix this error I should ensure that class name in class wrapper is not misspelled.
